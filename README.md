### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zubeir from Orange County, California. I enjoy learning but specifically learning within Python and Data Science. I try to take on fun projects that I can further learn about a topic, make predictions aboure my interests, or create models for things I like to write about in my substack here: ttfd.substack.com or on my linkedin here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zubeir-said/.
