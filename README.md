I'm Zubeir from Orange County, California. I enjoy learning but specifically within Python and data science. I try to take on fun projects that I can further learn about a topic, make predictions about my interests, or create models for things I like to write about in my substack here: ttfd.substack.com or on my LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zubeir-said/.



Skills: Python | Scikit-Learn| PySpark | PyTorch | JS | Django
